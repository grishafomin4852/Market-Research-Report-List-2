Soft wax is applied to the skin in a thin layer, covered with a cloth strip, and then swiftly pulled off in the opposite direction of hair growth. It is commonly used for larger body areas like legs and arms. On the other hand, hard wax is applied directly to the skin without the need for cloth strips. Once it hardens, it is lifted off on its own, making it suitable for more sensitive areas like the bikini line and face.</p></p>
