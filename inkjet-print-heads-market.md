<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Inkjet Print Heads Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Piezoelectric Type (Bulk Piezo, Thin Film Piezo)</li><li>Thermal Type</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Inkjet print heads are divided into two main types: piezoelectric and thermal. Piezoelectric print heads can be further classified as bulk piezo or thin film piezo. The bulk piezo type works by applying pressure to a reservoir of ink, forcing it through the print head nozzles. The thin film piezo type uses a thin film of piezoelectric material to create pressure, allowing precise control over droplet size and placement. On the other hand, thermal print heads heat ink and create vapor bubbles that propel the ink onto the paper. Each type offers unique advantages and is suited for different applications in the printing industry.</p></p>
