<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Three phase Circuit Breaker Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Manual Reset</li><li>Automatic Reset</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The manual reset circuit breaker market refers to the demand for circuit breakers that require a manual reset after they trip due to overload or short circuit. These breakers offer increased safety as they cannot be easily reset, preventing accidental re-energizing of the circuit. On the other hand, the automatic reset circuit breaker market involves circuit breakers that automatically reset themselves after tripping once the fault is cleared. This type is convenient as it eliminates the need for manual intervention, making it suitable for applications where frequent trips may occur.</p></p>
