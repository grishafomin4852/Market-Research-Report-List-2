<p><strong>The Glass Free 3D TV Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Active 3D TV</li><li>Passive 3D TV</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Glass Free 3D TV market includes two main types: Active 3D TV and Passive 3D TV. Active 3D TVs require battery-powered glasses to create the 3D effect, using alternating images on the screen. These glasses are synchronized with the TV, providing a high-resolution 3D experience with vivid colors. On the other hand, Passive 3D TVs use inexpensive polarized glasses which do not require batteries. They work by displaying two different images simultaneously, each with a polarized filter, providing a more comfortable viewing experience but with a slightly lower resolution.</p></p>
